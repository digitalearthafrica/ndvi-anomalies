# Digital Earth Africa Continental Testing Folder

### Background 

Landsat satellites have the longest temporal record of earth observations data, from landsat 5, 7 and 8. Ideally, the Landsat data record should be consistent over the Landsat sensor series, but that's not being the case Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) has improved calibration than the previous Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +). To calibrate the two sensors sample collection points are taken across the Africa continent. These points will aid in the harmonising landsat 7 and 8.


This sections focuses 

* Continental data collection for harmonizing ARD Landsat 5-7 with Landsat 8
* Determining the equation for Harmonization of the Landsat collection 2
* Testing of the Harmonization Equation on the Landsat collection 2
